# Super Simple Bookkeeping App

For this project I created a super simple bookkeeping app. The user can add, delete and search invoices by company name. The app adds the amount of the invoices together and calculates the value added tax of the total amount. It was an especially fun project to create because along the way, besides reading up on functional and object oriented programing paradigms, I also learned how to use Context in react.

The code contains pure functions, higher order functions, array methods.
